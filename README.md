TheHardestDungeonEver
=====================

A libgdx game that was created in 48 hours during the SPJam 2014, a braziliam JAM to those who lives in SÃ£o Paulo.
The game consists in two main gameplays: a dungeon crawler, where the player must defeat the monsters, and a bullet storm (named as touhou), where the enemies, who were not defeated, will shoot at many directions.

This project uses a lot of conception of Stages and Actors usage, and some usage of bounding boxes and animation.
